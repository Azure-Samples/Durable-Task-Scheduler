## What is Durable Task?

[Durable Task](http://aka.ms/durabletask) is Microsoft's technology for building workflows and orchestrations as ordinary code that automatically survives failures. Instead of managing complex retry logic, state machines, or message queues, you express your business logic as straightforward functions - Durable Task handles state persistence, automatic recovery, and distributed coordination for you. 

Workflows can run for hours, days, or even months, reliably resuming from the last completed step after any crash, restart, or redeployment. Common use cases include distributed transactions, multi-agent AI orchestration, data processing pipelines, and infrastructure management.

Durable Task encompasses the Durable Task SDKs for self-hosted applications, [Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) for serverless hosting on Azure Functions, and the [Durable Task Scheduler](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler) - a fully managed backend service purpose-built for durable workloads.

#### What is Durable Execution?

Durable execution is an industry-wide approach to making ordinary code fault-tolerant by automatically persisting its progress.

## Why Durable Task Scheduler?

- 🏗️ **Fully managed** - no storage accounts to configure, no infrastructure to maintain
- ⚡ **Purpose-built & fast** - optimized compute+memory; push-model gRPC streaming (no polling)
- 📊 **Built-in dashboard** - monitor orchestrations, drill into history, pause/terminate/restart instances ([Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler-dashboard))
- 🛡️ **Fault isolation** - runs as a separate Azure resource; failures don't cascade to your app
- 📈 **Independent scaling** - scheduler scales separately from your app; multiple apps can share one scheduler
- 🗂️ **Multiple task hubs** - isolate workloads by environment, team, or project ([Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler#multiple-task-hubs))
- 🐳 **Emulator for local dev** - Docker-based emulator with dashboard included, zero Azure dependency
- 🔐 **Identity-based auth** - Microsoft Entra ID / managed identity, no secrets in connection strings ([Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler-identity))
- 🌍 **Run anywhere** - Azure Functions, Container Apps, AKS, App Service, VMs

## ⚡ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Start the emulator

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:latest
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8082:8082 mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:latest
```

### Step 2: Pick your language and run a sample

| Language | Quickstart Sample | Run Command |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| .NET | Function Chaining | `cd samples/durable-task-sdks/dotnet/FunctionChaining/Worker && dotnet run` |
| Python | Function Chaining | `cd samples/durable-task-sdks/python/function-chaining && pip install -r requirements.txt && python worker.py` |
| Java | Function Chaining | `cd samples/durable-task-sdks/java/function-chaining && ./gradlew runChainingPattern` |
| JavaScript | Function Chaining | `cd samples/durable-task-sdks/javascript/function-chaining && npm install && node worker.mjs` |

### Step 3: Open the dashboard

Navigate to **[http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)** to view orchestration status, history, and more.

## Choose Your Framework

| | Durable Functions | Durable Task SDKs |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Serverless event-driven apps | Any compute (containers, VMs, etc.) |
| **Hosting** | Azure Functions | Any host (ACA, AKS, App Service, VMs) |
| **Triggers** | HTTP, Timer, Queue, etc. | Self-managed |
| **Scaling** | Built-in auto-scale | Bring your own scaling |
| **Languages** | .NET, Python, Java, JavaScript | .NET, Python, Java, JavaScript |

## Observability

The Durable Task Scheduler provides a **built-in dashboard** for monitoring orchestration instances, inspecting execution history, and managing running workflows. The SDKs also support **OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** for end-to-end visibility across services. Durable Functions users can leverage [distributed tracing V2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-diagnostics#distributed-tracing) for enhanced diagnostics.
