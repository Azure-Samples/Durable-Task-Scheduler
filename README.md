## What is Durable Execution?

[Durable execution](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler) is a fault-tolerant approach to running code that handles failures and interruptions through automatic retries and state persistence. Your orchestration logic is checkpointed at every step, so if a process crashes or a VM reboots, execution resumes exactly where it left off. Common use cases include distributed transactions, multi-agent AI orchestration, data processing pipelines, and infrastructure management. Paired with a developer framework like [Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) or the Durable Task SDKs, the scheduler lets you author stateful apps on any compute without architecting for fault tolerance yourself.

## Why Durable Task Scheduler?

- 🏗️ **Fully managed** — no storage accounts to configure, no infrastructure to maintain
- ⚡ **Purpose-built & fast** — optimized compute+memory; push-model gRPC streaming (no polling)
- 📊 **Built-in dashboard** — monitor orchestrations, drill into history, pause/terminate/restart instances ([Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler-dashboard))
- 🛡️ **Fault isolation** — runs as a separate Azure resource; failures don't cascade to your app
- 📈 **Independent scaling** — scheduler scales separately from your app; multiple apps can share one scheduler
- 🗂️ **Multiple task hubs** — isolate workloads by environment, team, or project ([Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler#multiple-task-hubs))
- 🐳 **Emulator for local dev** — Docker-based emulator with dashboard included, zero Azure dependency
- 🔐 **Identity-based auth** — Microsoft Entra ID / managed identity, no secrets in connection strings ([Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/durable-task-scheduler-identity))
- 🌍 **Run anywhere** — Azure Functions, Container Apps, AKS, App Service, VMs

## ⚡ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Start the emulator

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:latest
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8082:8082 mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:latest
```

### Step 2: Pick your language and run a sample

| Language | Quickstart Sample | Run Command |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| .NET | Function Chaining | `cd samples/durable-task-sdks/dotnet/FunctionChaining/Worker && dotnet run` |
| Python | Function Chaining | `cd samples/durable-task-sdks/python/function-chaining && pip install -r requirements.txt && python worker.py` |
| Java | Function Chaining | `cd samples/durable-task-sdks/java/function-chaining && ./gradlew runChainingPattern` |

### Step 3: Open the dashboard

Navigate to **[http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)** to view orchestration status, history, and more.

## Choose Your Framework

| | Durable Functions | Durable Task SDKs |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Serverless event-driven apps | Any compute (containers, VMs, etc.) |
| **Hosting** | Azure Functions | Any host (ACA, AKS, App Service, VMs) |
| **Triggers** | HTTP, Timer, Queue, etc. | Self-managed |
| **Scaling** | Built-in auto-scale | Bring your own scaling |
| **Languages** | .NET, Python, Java, JavaScript | .NET, Python, Java |

### Featured Samples

🤖 **[AI Research Agent](./samples/durable-task-sdks/python/arXiv_research_agent)** — Autonomous academic research agent that searches arXiv, analyzes papers, and synthesizes reports (Python)

✈️ **[AI Travel Planner](./samples/durable-functions/dotnet/AiAgentTravelPlanOrchestrator)** — Multi-agent travel planning with specialized agents and human approval (Durable Functions, .NET)

🛒 **[Order Processor](./samples/durable-functions/dotnet/OrderProcessor)** — End-to-end order workflow with inventory, payment, and notifications (Durable Functions, .NET)

## Observability

The Durable Task Scheduler provides a **built-in dashboard** for monitoring orchestration instances, inspecting execution history, and managing running workflows. The SDKs also support **OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** for end-to-end visibility across services. Durable Functions users can leverage [distributed tracing V2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-diagnostics#distributed-tracing) for enhanced diagnostics.
