# Hello World with the Durable Task Framework (DTFx)

In addition to [Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview), the [Durable Task Framework (DTFx)](https://github.com/Azure/durabletask) for .NET can also use the Durable Task Scheduler service for managing orchestration state.

> **NOTE:**
> DTFx is not an officially supported product. It is provided as-is, without warranty or support. Unless you are already using DTFx, we recommend using Durable Functions for new projects.

This directory includes a sample .NET console app that demonstrates how to use the Durable Task Scheduler with DTFx.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Creating a Durable Task Scheduler task hub

Before you can run the app, you need to create a Durable Task Scheduler task hub in Azure and produce a connection string that references it.

> **NOTE**: These are abbreviated instructions for simplicity. For a full set of instructions, see the Azure Durable Functions [QuickStart guide](../../../quickstarts/HelloCities/README.md#create-a-durable-task-scheduler-namespace-and-task-hub).

1. Install the Durable Task Scheduler CLI extension:

    ```bash
    az upgrade
    az extension add --name durabletask --allow-preview true
    ```

1. Create a resource group:

    ```powershell
    az group create --name my-resource-group --location northcentralus
    ```

1. Create a Durable Task Scheduler:

    ```powershell
    az durabletask scheduler create -n "my-schduler" -g "my-resource-group" -l "northcentralus" --ip-allowlist "[0.0.0.0/0]" --sku-name "dedicated" --sku-capacity "1"
    ```

1. Create a task hub within the scheduler:

    ```powershell
    az durabletask taskhub create -g my-resource-group --scheduler my-scheduler --name default
    ```

1. Get the connection string for the task hub:

    ```powershell
    $endpoint = az durabletask scheduler show `
        -g my-resource-group `
        -n my-scheduler `
        --query "properties.url" `
        -o tsv
    $connectionString = "Endpoint=$endpoint;TaskHub=default;Authentication=DefaultAzure"
    ```

1. Set the `DTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to the connection string:

    ```powershell
    $env:DTS_CONNECTION_STRING = $connectionString
    ```

    Note that the `DTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is used by the sample app to connect to the Durable Task Scheduler service.

1. Grant the current user permission to connect to the `default` task hub:

    ```powershell
    $subscriptionId = az account show --query "id" -o tsv
    $loggedInUser = az account show --query "user.name" -o tsv

    az role assignment create `
        --assignee $loggedInUser `
        --role "Durable Task Data Contributor" `
        --scope "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.DurableTask/schedulers/my-scheduler/taskHubs/default"
    ```

    Note that it may take a minute for the role assignment to take effect.

## Running the sample

In the same terminal window as above, use the following steps to run the DTFx sample on your local machine.

1. Clone this repository.

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `samples/dtfx/HelloWorld` directory.

1. Run the following command to build and run the sample:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

You should see output similar to the following:

## View orchestrations in the dashboard

You can view the orchestrations in the Durable Task Scheduler dashboard by navigating to the scheduler-specific dashboard URL in your browser.

Use the following PowerShell command to get the dashboard URL:

```powershell
$baseUrl = az durabletask scheduler show `
    -g my-resource-group `
    -n my-scheduler `
    --query "properties.dashboardUrl" `
    -o tsv
$dashboardUrl = "$baseUrl/taskHubs/default"
$dashboardUrl
```

The URL should look something like the following:

```plaintext
https://my-scheduler-atdngmgxfsh0-db.northcentralus.durabletask.io/taskHubs/default
```

Once logged in, you should see the orchestrations that were created by the sample app. Below is an example of what the dashboard might look like (note that some of the details will be different than the screenshot):
