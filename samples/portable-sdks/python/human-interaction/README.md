# Human Interaction Pattern

This sample demonstrates the human interaction pattern with the Azure Durable Task Scheduler using the Python SDK. This pattern enables workflows that require manual approval or input from humans before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

1. [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
3. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for emulator option)

## Sample Overview

In this sample, the orchestration demonstrates the human interaction pattern by:

1. Submitting an approval request
2. Waiting for a human to approve or reject before continuing
3. Processing the approval response or handling a timeout if no response is received

This pattern is useful for scenarios where a workflow requires human input before proceeding.

## Running the Examples

There are two separate ways to run an example:

- Using the Emulator
- Using a deployed Scheduler and Taskhub

### Running with a Deployed Scheduler and Taskhub Resource

1. To create a taskhub, follow these steps using the Azure CLI commands:

Create a Scheduler:

```bash
az durabletask scheduler create --resource-group --name --location --ip-allowlist "[0.0.0.0/0]" --sku-capacity 1 --sku-name "Dedicated" --tags "{'myattribute':'myvalue'}"
```

Create Your Taskhub:

```bash
az durabletask taskhub create --resource-group <testrg> --scheduler-name <testscheduler> --name <testtaskhub>
```

2. Retrieve the Endpoint for the Scheduler: Locate the taskhub in the Azure portal to find the endpoint.

3. Set the Environment Variables:

Bash:
```bash
export TASKHUB=<taskhubname>
export ENDPOINT=<taskhubEndpoint>
```

Powershell:
```powershell
$env:TASKHUB = "<taskhubname>"
$env:ENDPOINT = "<taskhubEndpoint>"
```

4. Install the Correct Packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Grant your developer credentials the Durable Task Data Contributor Role.

### Running with the Emulator

The emulator simulates a scheduler and taskhub, packaged into an easy-to-use Docker container. For these steps, it is assumed that you are using port 8080.

1. Install Docker: If it is not already installed.

2. Pull the Docker Image for the Emulator:

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:v0.0.6
```

3. Run the Emulator: Wait a few seconds for the container to be ready.

```bash
docker run --name dtsemulator -d -p 8080:8080 mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:v0.0.4
```

4. Set the Environment Variables:

Bash:
```bash
export TASKHUB=<taskhubname>
export ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080
```

Powershell:
```powershell
$env:TASKHUB = "<taskhubname>"
$env:ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080"
```

5. Edit the Examples: Change the `token_credential` input of both the `DurableTaskSchedulerWorker` and `DurableTaskSchedulerClient` to `None`.

## Sample Explanation

The human interaction pattern is essential for workflows that require human approval or input before proceeding. Key aspects of this pattern include:

1. Submitting a request for human review
2. Suspending execution while waiting for a response
3. Handling responses (approval/rejection) when received
4. Managing timeouts if no response is received within a designated period

Common use cases include:
- Expense approval workflows
- Content moderation systems
- Change management processes
- Access request approvals

In this sample, the orchestration submits an approval request and then waits for either a human response (approve/reject) or a timeout. The FastAPI application provides endpoints for creating requests and responding to them, simulating a real-world approval system.
