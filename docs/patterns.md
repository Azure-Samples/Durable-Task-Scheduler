# Orchestration Patterns

This guide maps each common orchestration pattern to available samples and documentation. All patterns can be developed locally using the [Durable Task Scheduler emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-task-scheduler/develop-with-durable-task-scheduler).

## Function Chaining
Sequential execution of activities where the output of one becomes the input of the next.

```
Activity A → Activity B → Activity C → Result
```

**Use cases:** Data processing pipelines, multi-step approval workflows, document generation

## Fan-out/Fan-in
Execute multiple activities in parallel and aggregate results when all complete.

```
         ┌→ Activity A ─┐
Input ───┼→ Activity B ──┼→ Aggregate → Result
         └→ Activity C ─┘
```

**Use cases:** Batch processing, parallel API calls, map-reduce operations

## Async HTTP API
Start a long-running operation via HTTP and poll for results.

```
Client → POST /start → 202 Accepted (with status URL)
Client → GET /status  → 200 Running...
Client → GET /status  → 200 Completed (with result)
```

**Use cases:** Long-running API operations, background job processing

## Human Interaction
Pause an orchestration to wait for external input (approval, user decision) with timeout support.

```
Orchestration → Wait for approval event
                  ├→ Approved → Continue
                  └→ Timeout  → Escalate/Cancel
```

**Use cases:** Approval workflows, manual review steps, interactive processes

---

## Monitoring
Periodic polling pattern that checks status at intervals until a condition is met.

```
Check status → Not ready → Wait → Check status → Ready → Done
```

**Use cases:** Health checks, deployment monitoring, SLA enforcement

| Language | Durable Task SDK | Durable Functions |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| .NET | [Sample](../samples/durable-task-sdks/dotnet/Monitoring) | — |

## Sub-orchestrations
Compose complex workflows by calling child orchestrations from a parent.

```
Parent Orchestration
  ├→ Sub-orchestration A → Result A
  └→ Sub-orchestration B → Result B
```

**Use cases:** Modular workflow design, code reuse, scoped retry logic

## Eternal Orchestrations
Long-running orchestrations that use `continue_as_new` to prevent unbounded history growth.

```
Process batch → Continue as new → Process batch → Continue as new → ...
```

**Use cases:** Event processors, scheduled jobs, continuous monitoring

## Durable Entities
Stateful objects that persist their state and support operations via messages.

```
Entity: Counter
  ├→ Add(5)  → State: 5
  ├→ Add(3)  → State: 8
  └→ Get()   → Returns: 8
```

**Use cases:** Shopping carts, user sessions, aggregations, IoT device state

## Saga / Compensation
Execute a sequence of operations with compensating actions if any step fails.

```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 (fails!)
                    └→ Compensate Step 2 → Compensate Step 1
```

**Use cases:** Distributed transactions, order processing, booking systems
